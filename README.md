Editing this tutorial
=====================

This tutorial is written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), because it rocks.

The actual content is defined in `Story.elm` where you can specify pages
in terms of incremental buildups.

In order to rebuild the pages, simply type make. To publish them, use
`make publish`.
